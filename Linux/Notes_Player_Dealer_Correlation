Summary of your findings noting the player and dealer you believe are colluding to scam Lucky Duck.


Billy Jones and Mylie Schmidt are the colluding parties primarily because their names appear most frequently, 15 and 13 times 
respsectively, during the dates and times that Lucky Duck experiences heavy losses.

Typically there is at least a seven hour minimum gap between when a Dealer's name shows up on the schedule for Black Jack, Routelette, or
Texas Hold'em, but in the case of Billy Jones, the name appears a mimimum of at least two hours in between games.

When heavy losses were experienced on the 10th, 12th, and 15th days of March, I found that Dealer Billy Jones and Player Mylie Schmidt 
appeared together at the Routellet Table a total of 15 and 13 times respectively.

At 8AM on March 10th and 12th, as well as at 5AM on March 12th when Lucky Duck was dealt thier largest losses, both Billy Jones and 
Mylie Schmidt were present.

Lucky Duck took losses in excess of $65,000 when the colluding parties were at the Roulette table, and the loss amounts were always 
similar, and in most cases just shy of a few numbers. At 5AM on all three days for example, the losses were $82,348 and $182,300 and 
$82,844.
