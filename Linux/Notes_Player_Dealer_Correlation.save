Summary of your findings noting the player and dealer you believe are colluding to scam Lucky Duck.



When heavy losses were experienced on the 10th, 12th, and 15th days of March, I found that Roulette dealer Billy Jones, and player Mylie 
Schmidt, appeared together at the Routellet Table a total of 15 and 13 times respectively, and are colluding to scam Lucky Duck.

Each Dealer had at mimimum a seven hour gap between either coming back to the Roulette Table or switching to Black Jack or Texas Hold em.
However there was at minimum a one or two hour gap in betweeen when Billy Jones' name would show up, meaning he was the most frequent
dealer present at the times of major losses. This is especially so for March 12 at 5AM and 8AM when Lucky Duck experienced their most 
significant losses.

Make sure to document your specific reasons for this finding.
